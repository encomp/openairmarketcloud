# Open Air Market

### Description
The goal of the app is to develop a point of sale (POS) app. The point of sale allows a merchant to 
calculate the amount owed by a customer. The application prepares a ticket for the customer and 
indicates the available options for the customer to perform the payment. It is also the point at 
which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods. Upon receiving the payment, 
the merchant may issue a receipt for the transaction, which is printed or emailed to the customer.
