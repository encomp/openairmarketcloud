# Open Air Market

### Description
The goal of the app is to develop a point of sale (POS) app. The point of sale allows a merchant to 
calculate the amount owed by a customer. The application prepares a ticket for the customer and 
indicates the available options for the customer to perform the payment. It is also the point at 
which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods. Upon receiving the payment, 
the merchant may issue a receipt for the transaction, which is printed or emailed to the customer.

### Intended User
The user based for the app are retail merchants that lack a POS. The goal of the system is to allow 
merchants to define the products and allow them to perform sale transactions. The system will allow 
merchants to have more than one terminal if needed since the POS backend is cloud base.
